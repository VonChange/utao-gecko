	uses-sdk:minSdkVersion 16 cannot be smaller than version 21 declared in library [org.mozilla.geckoview:geckoview:119.0.20231108221453] /Users/vonchange/.gradle/caches/transforms-4/4d681ee2feee8457d5e34c2a30f7f226/transformed/geckoview-119.0.20231108221453/AndroidManifest.xml as the library might be using APIs not available in 16
	Suggestion: use a compatible library with a minSdk of at most 16,
		or increase this project's minSdk version to at least 21,
		or use tools:overrideLibrary="org.mozilla.geckoview" to force usage (may lead to runtime failures)
